<h1>Proposed Trajectory Comparison Method</h1>

<h3>JADON WAGSTAFF - May 3, 2017</h3>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>An important topic in ecology is yearly migratory trajectories of birds. Ecologists would like to know
whether a birds trajectory diverges for fall and spring migration, and how much the trajectories
diverge each year. They would also like to know how individual yearly migration divergences
compare to trajectory divergences of other individuals or species. The advent of satellite tracking
of small gps units attached to birds has made data collection of migration routs a reality. Ecologists
are now able to gather large amounts of data relevant to the above questions; however, the methods
currently used to analyze this data ignore a large portion of the data-points. Here I propose a method
to compare migration trajectories through the use of a modified version of persistent homology.</p>

<h2>Related Work</h2>

<p>The current methods [2, 3] in comparing trajectories for bird migration is the following. A discrete
number of latitudes are chosen along the migration trajectories, usually less than ten. For each
latitude, the corresponding longitude is found along each of the trajectories. The longitude values
are then used as a metric to compare two trajectories. Statistical methods such as ANOVA can
then be used to answer questions about migration.</p>

<h2>Contribution</h2>

<p>There are some problems with the approach outlined above. First, migration trajectories are not
always monotonic, if a bird makes a detour there may be two longitude values for a given latitude.
Second, the longitude metric is not equivalent at two different latitudes. And third, only a small
subset of the trajectory is considered for comparison.</p>

<p>To remedy these problems, a new method is proposed based on persistent homology. The
method will calculate dimension one persistence with data from two trajectories, then the Wasserstein metric or the bottleneck metric could be used to compare trajectory pairs. To demonstrate
the usefulness of this method, migration trajectory data for <i>Cathartes aura</i> (turkey vultures) [1]
will be used to test the algorithm.</p>

<h2>Proposed Method</h2>

<p>In the proposed method, edges between sequential points in a trajectory are present at the start of
the filtration, and the points in each trajectory corresponding to the wintering (breeding) areas are
connected together. The result is a single connected component with one dimension-one homology
group. A filtration is then made for this new structure; there is however, one constraint. In order
to detect divergences, only edges between trajectories are allowed to be formed. The downside is
that this may affect the theoretical guarantees about persistent homology. An algorithm was developed 
in C++ to calculate the filtration. The algorithm took advantage of the structure of the problem and
ran in n^2 time with n space.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>The result of this algorithm is a persistence diagram showing divergences between two trajectories.
Prominent divergences are marked by large differences in birth and death. These persistence
diagrams can be compared using bottleneck distance or Wasserstein distance to compare different
pairs of trajectories. For example, consider this paper [3] which compares consistency of long
distance bird migration between two species. The Wasserstein distance could be used to compare all
pairs of trajectories north and all pairs of trajectories south for one species. The mean distance and
standard deviation of these values from one species could be compared to the mean and standard
deviation of values obtained from another species. For a few examples of what the persistence
diagram would look like with a given trajectory, look at the figures below. The
algorithm was implemented comparing the north and south migration for a year of two different
birds.</p><br>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The algorithm proposed may be useful for Ecologists to utilize more of their data and detect patterns
of interest in migration trajectories. More work is required to test the theoretical guarantees of the
constraints on persistent homology, as well as proving the accuracy of the algorithm. After that,
the method would need to be implemented on data where patterns have been recognized to test
the validity of using persistence diagrams as a metric. Topological techniques seem to have merit
for this type of data, and further investigation into the subject would be justified.</p>
